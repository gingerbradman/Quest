    a straight corridor of cavernous walls. At the end is an opening that splits
    into three different paths. The path to the left is quiet but well lit. You can
    hear cursing and sounds of chips falling from the path straight ahead. On your
    right the path appears dark. In the center of this cross roads is a stool and
    a conveinently sleeping guard. '
