  defaultText: You carefully pick up a few books next to the latrine, some of these
    are nothing but garbage, romance and smut. However, one thicker book catches
    your eye. 'Goblin-Tounge and why you should speak it' is a book with no visible
    pictures and was obviously not a fan-favorite of the latrine goers. You give
    the pages a few flips and think you've got a good grasp on how to Glarf then
    Brrrnglee.
