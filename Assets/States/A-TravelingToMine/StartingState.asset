  defaultText: 'You awaken strapped to the backside of a horse with your hands tied
    behind your back. The dull colors of the road and landscape almost seem to merge
    together in your vision. Behind you are your people, the villagers of Garfen,
    in shackles, ropes and cuffs bounded together in a train following your captor''s
    horse. Your captor and his compatriots surrounding your people are dressed in
    tattered robes and disorderly soldier armor. Deserters.
