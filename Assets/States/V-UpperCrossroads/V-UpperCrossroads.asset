  defaultText: As you round the corner, you find yourself at split paths. You hear
    the sounds of guardsmen speaking to each other from a well-lit room. Nearby you
    see another enormous room that appears to look like an old quarry. And there
    is a final path, a long hallway that seems to go on for a while.
