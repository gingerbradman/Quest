  defaultText: Before you are multiple people in rags and disheveled clothes tirelessly
    hacking away at the stone walls with pickaxes. Around them are the occasional
    guard keeping watch. In the corner there is a small group of prisoners resting
    from continous work. None of the guards have noticed you but there are quite
    a few of them. You believe you could easily move around the quarry without becoming
    too suspicious.
