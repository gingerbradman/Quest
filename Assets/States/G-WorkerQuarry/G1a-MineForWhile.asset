  defaultText: You strike the cold stone earth infront of you. Sparks fly and dust
    makes it difficult to breathe. After minutes your arms become sore and your stamina
    drains. Your work is not for nothing, however, because your last few strikes
    unearthed a small piece of blue stone, shiny and vibrant. When you are sure a
    guard is looking away, you quickly pocket the item. It appears to have characters
    on it, but you don't understand the language.
