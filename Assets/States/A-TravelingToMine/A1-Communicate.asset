    They are dressed similarly to the others except for a mask covering their entire
    face. Glancing at the mask, you see a design similar to a tapestry but confined

    spined-fish swims through a body of water with other smaller fish floating to
    the surface, dead. "Silence." they say in a coarse voice.
