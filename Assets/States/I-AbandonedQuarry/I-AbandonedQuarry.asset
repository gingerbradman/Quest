  defaultText: This room opens into a cavernous...well...cavern! The evidence of
    work on the stones is obvious that this was once a quarry, but no one works here
    now as it is deathly silent. There are two paths in and out of here. Both are
    well lit, one is back into the bowels of the cave and the other looks like some
    sort of guard outpost.
