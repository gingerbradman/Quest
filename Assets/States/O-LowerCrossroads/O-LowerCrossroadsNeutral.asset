  defaultText: Around you are some slightly glowing mushrooms that illuminate the
    multiple paths before you. One path seems to get even darker and as you turn
    your head that way it smells of rot and its absolutely terrible stentch assualts
    your nose. A separate path seems to grow brighter and you hear the crittering
    of multipl creatures. Another path seems well-lit enough, but is deathly quiet.
    Of course, you could always slip back through that barricade.
