  defaultText: With a headache, you awaken once more. This time free from your horse-shaped
    prison cell in favor of a cell with actual bars and cave walls. "Still alive?"
    A guard says from outside your cell  "Try not to cause any problems. We'll be
    shipping you away soon." He says before leaving. You notice a stranger in the
    cell with you, dressed in simple pieces of cloth and chained to the wall. "Name's
    Hans, you ok?", says the stranger.
