  defaultText: 'Time passes and you begin to feel better, more like yourself. After
    a while you drift off to sleep. Dreams come to you in rather sudden states. You
    have a dream about:


    1. (Fighter) Winning glory, fighting for honor and
    battling with all manner of weapons

    2. (Wizard) Traveling to far off places,
    magic and conjuring creatures

    3. (Bard) Cleverly tricking those around you,
    seducing those most beautiful and having a way with words'
