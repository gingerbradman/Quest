  defaultText: While the hallway leading here was full of crates, the room itself
    is instead filled with tables, chairs and beds. You imagine this is a barracks
    for your captors. In the center are three guards playing cards, there's an additional
    guard in the corner who appears to be reading. This room has multiple ways out,
    one going towards the cells, one with more crates and barrels and another that
    seems to go to some divergent paths. You don't imagine you can sneak by the table
    of guards to go down the divergent path.
