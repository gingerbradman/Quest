  defaultText: You and the eldery goblin walk up to the plateau of the larger tent.
    "Before we go in, let me do some sweet talking." she gives you a too-few toothy
    smile before walking into the tent. You hear the chittering of the goblin language
    for a while. Eventually a hand motions you in from the tent. As you move the
    curtains of the tent to the side you finally catch a view of the other speaker.
    A large bipedal creature with brown skin. You presume is Horb. "What is your
    plan, creature." He grumbles at you.
