  defaultText: The crates and barrels have nothing of interest inside of them. However,
    as you move them around you notice something strange on the cavern wall behind
    them. The wall here appears to have some runes and shapes etched into the stones.
    Letters from a language you don't recognize. Maybe there is something special
    here?
