  defaultText: The room here is filled with tables, chairs and beds. You imagine
    this is a barracks for your captors. In the center are three guards playing cards,
    there's an additional guard in the corner who appears to be reading. This room
    has multiple ways out, one going towards the cells, one with more crates and
    barrels and another that seems to go to some divergent paths. From this side
    of the room, you doubt you could make it to the other paths without being noticed.
